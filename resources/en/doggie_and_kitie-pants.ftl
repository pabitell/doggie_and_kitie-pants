doggie_and_kitie-pants-home-long-2 =
    „Even in woods,“ said kitie. „But it is a pitty, that we
    don't have any sunshade, when the sun shines so nicely and I'd
    look really nice in the woods. Surely nobody hasn't a cat with
    a sunshade.“

doggie_and_kitie-pants-home-long-3 =
    „Sun makes you no harm, at least you'd become a bit tan,“ argued
    doggie; „you seem a bit pale afther the long winter. So don't lick to long
    and lets go!“

doggie_and_kitie-pants-home-long-4 =
    „Ok, ok, you know I need to prepare a bit, when I go out on Sunday,“
    replied kitie. „A persons should take care of himself a bit. Look at you

    supposed to be worn in the same manner.“

doggie_and_kitie-pants-home-long-5 =
    Doggie fixed his ears and they left. On the way they talk about what should
    they do in the woods. That They'll play hide and seek, Hansel and Gretel and

    look at the blue sky above.

    As they were talking a rabbit stared at them from bushes.
    „Haha,“ he start mocking, „that dog has one ear up and the second askew! Like this,“

    Doggie hadn't payed attention and both of his ears were different.

doggie_and_kitie-pants-bushes-long-1 =
    „Look, he is mocking you!“ said kitie. Doggie got mad and started
    to chase the rabbit in the bushes.

    As they went on, they met children who where also gonig for a walk.
    Children wondered how it is possible that a dog and a cat are walking

    začaly smát. „Ouh ouh,“ cried, „look girls, look boys that doggie has ripped
    pants! We can see his shirt comming from the pants!

doggie_and_kitie-pants-meadow-long-1 =
    „Is it true that I had ripped pants,“ asked doggie. „Come kitie, come and see.“

doggie_and_kitie-pants-meadow-long-2 =
    Kitie observed doggie from all sides: „Yes, doggie, it seems so.
    Your pants are ripped in the back. Shame on you.“

doggie_and_kitie-pants-meadow-long-3 =
    „I must happened when I chased the rabbit into thorns,“ moaned
    doggie. „Such a shame, these ripped pants during Easter Sunday.
    If only we could fix it. Do you by any chance have a thread?“

doggie_and_kitie-pants-meadow-long-4 =
    „I don't,“ said kitie, „but perhaps will find
    some piece of string or something similar.“

doggie_and_kitie-pants-meadow-long-5 =
    „Look,“ doggie looked around, „there, I think that somenthing is there!“
    They were both looking and there was an earthworm. It laid strait and thought
    that nobody saw it.

doggie_and_kitie-pants-meadow-long-6 =
    „But it is strait,“ kitie poked the earthworm, „it is a pencil.“
    The earthworm became frightened and rolled up.

doggie_and_kitie-pants-meadow-long-7 =
    „On no,“ cried doggie, „that is no pencil, you see, it is a string!
    Take it and sew the pants!“

doggie_and_kitie-pants-meadow-long-8 =
    Kittie took the earthworm and sewed doggie's pants unsing the earthworm.

doggie_and_kitie-pants-meadow-long-9 =
    „Now nobody will laugh at me,“ enjoied doggie and they went further
    talking about Snow White and Seven ravens.

doggie_and_kitie-pants-courtyard-long-0 =
    As they went, the earthworm got over the shock.
    „I'm really no string, I'm an earthworm,“ it realized and started
    silently crawl from the pants out. It was very hard, because kitie
    did really a good job while she had sawed her. But in the end it
    managed and it was half way out. „You see, that I'm an earthworm,“
    it said, „they'll see, once I'll be entirely out.“
    An hen went by and saw, that an earthworm was comming out of doggie's
    pants. „Wait a bit,“ she said to doggie, „here,“ and she pulled
    the earthworm out and ate it. „here was an earthworm and I think that
    it made hole in your pants. I wouldn't belive that earthworms can
    also eat pants. The world is so wicked these days. So I punished it:
    I ate it and it's dead.“

doggie_and_kitie-pants-courtyard-long-1 =
    Kitie observed and saw, that doggie's pants are ripped again.
    „But that was a string to sew the pants,“ said kitie to the hen,
    „and you ate it.“
    „No no,“ said the hen, „cross my heart, it was an earthworm and no
    string; You'd saw how it twisted! I know earthworms and I just felt
    like eating one. And if you want to sew the pants - it is really
    a shame to have a hole in pants especially on Easter Sunday - I don't
    have a needle nor a thread, but if you go a bit further, a dressmaker
    lives there and she'll sew it for you.“
    So they went together to dressmaker's.

doggie_and_kitie-pants-dressmakers-long-0 =
    „Hmm, lordy, that is a big hole,“ said the dressmaker, „but today is Easter
    Sunday and I don't sew. Unless you'd do somenthing for me first:
    You'd have to catch all mice in the pantry. But you can't drink milk
    or eat chocolate bunny or veal with stuffing!“. Doggie and kitie promissed
    that they catch mice and don't eat anything while doing it.
    Dressmaker took them to the pantry. Mice became scared and crawled into
    theirs mice holes.

doggie_and_kitie-pants-dressmakers-long-1 =
    „I'll lure them out,“ whispered kitie. „Stand here doggie, In the
    middle of the pantry and do some dancing and spinning and I'll
    do the rest.

doggie_and_kitie-pants-dressmakers-long-2 =
    Doggie stood in the middle of the pantry and vigorously started spinning
    and dancing.

doggie_and_kitie-pants-dressmakers-long-3 =
    „Wow!“ started kitie to shout, „that is so funny, so funny,
    there is a dog with ripped pants and he tries to dance and spin as well!“

doggie_and_kitie-pants-dressmakers-long-4 =
    So mice crawled out of their holes, laughed at doggie's pants and kitie caught
    them all, not even one left.
    „You did good,“ praised the dressmakers and sew doggie's hole in pants.
    „And since you haven't eaten anything there, I'll give you something
    to eat as well“. She gave them a glass of milk and a pice of cake each
    and doggie and kitie went happily home.
